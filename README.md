# activity_log

MAC ONLY

Track your activity on with a CLI that causes pop ups to remind you to log over some set time interval.  Ideally, you don't need any directions because the CLI will guide you through what you need.

For now, data is store in local JSON.  One day remote storage and multiple surfaces would be ideal.
